This repository contains the solutions of 8 labs completed as part of my university course "Mobile Systems Development". The focus of the course is on different aspects of mobile application development. To complete this course, I chose Python and its mobile development framework `Kivy`.

## Small Remark

I am aware of the existence of the Material Design widgets collection - `KivyMD`. The main goal of this project was not to create full-fledged visually appealing mobile applications for continuous use. The main goal of this work is **educational** - to learn how:

- to work with the development environment;

- to create complex widgets and combine them into functional groups;

- to design multi-page applications;

- to make visual part by writing `kv-files`, etc.

I also understand that Kivy cannot be used for corporate development of complex multi-user systems. This framework is more suitable for private development of small and medium-sized projects.

## Project Overview

This project is a collection of labs demonstrating the use of Kivy for solving various tasks, such as the implementation of widgets, single-page and multi-page applications or small embedded modules. The complexity of the task increases as you progress through the course, starting with simple widget implementations and gradually moving on to more complex applications.

## Labs Assignments

Each lab in this repository has its own README file (`<Lab name>_description.md`), which provides a detailed explanation of the assignment, its objectives, and the implementation details.

A brief overview of each lab:

- `Clicker/...`: using the example of a simple clicker, master the process of creating a new project, study its structure, learn build an application;

- `Containers and positioning/...`: master the basic skills of building user interfaces, positioning, rendering and moving elements;

- `Basic GUI elements/...`: learn how to use typical GUI elements;

- `Pages and screen/...`: learn how to organize multi-page applications, create dialog boxes and interact with them;

- `ListModel/...`: learn how to use the ListModel model to display data in scrollable lists, interact with a database, and manage application settings;

- `Custom components/...`: learn how to create a user interface configurable by states, implement animated transitions when changing states, and create your own components;

- `Py-objects to widgets/...`: learn how to use Python classes in creating your own components;

- `Working with multimedia/...`:
    - learn how to use the Canvas object for drawing;

    - master the implementation of animation using sprites;

    - learn how to use particles to create visual effects;

    - explore multimedia objects for embedding music and videos in an application.

To learn more about a specific lab, navigate to its corresponding folder and read the description file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies (see the "Dependencies" section above).

3. Navigate to the directory of the lab assignment you're interested in.

4. Run `src/main.py` file using a Python interpreter.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x

- Kivy (the latest version)

- additional libraries (see the description of the specific lab)

## Thanks

Many thanks to the Kivy development team, independent developers and opensourcers for creating and supporting this framework.
